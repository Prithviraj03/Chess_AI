# AI Course Project - Chess Framework

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for the AI course project from Missouri University of Science and Technology. It demonstrates my implementation of a chess-playing AI using Python3. The project adheres to coding standards and is structured in a modular, well-documented format for maintainability and clarity.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python3
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - Chess Framework: [Link to the documentation based on language, e.g., Python Chess Framework](https://siggame.github.io/Joueur.py/chess/index.html)
  - AI Algorithms: [Time Limited Iterative Deepening Minimax,Time Limited Iterative Deepening Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning]

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prithviraj03/Chess_AI.git
   cd Chess_AI
   bash```

2. Run the Program:
   ```bash
   # Make the script executable (if not already)
   chmod +x run.sh

   # Run the script
  ./run.sh

   bash```
